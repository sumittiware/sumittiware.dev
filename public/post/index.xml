      <description>In part 1, we provided a high-level overview of how we developed the search system at Alippo, focusing on ingestion processes and data synchronisation between the main database and the Elasticsearch cluster. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet, please check it out here.&#xA;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into the design choices we made to achieve our desired system. We analyzed the search systems of platforms like Udemy, Swiggy, and Zomato to guide our development.</description>

      <description>Search systems are crucial in most applications, enabling users to efficiently find products or information. At Alippo, we offer around 2,000 courses, so having an effective search system is essential for users to easily find courses that interest them.&#xA;Backstory At Alippo, our philosophy is to leverage existing open-source projects whenever possible. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel when brilliant solutions already exist. This approach applies to our search system as well.</description>

      <title>Move Constructors in C&#43;&#43; with Examples</title>

      <description>What is a Move Constructor? The copy constructors in C++ work with the l-value references and copy semantics(copy semantics means copying the actual data of the object to another object rather than making another object to point the already existing object in the heap). While move constructors work on the r-value references and move semantics(move semantics involves pointing to the already existing object in the memory).&#xA;On declaring the new object and assigning it with the r-value, firstly a temporary object is created, and then that temporary object is used to assign the values to the object.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites: lvalue and rvalue in C++, References in C++&#xA;“l-value” refers to a memory location that identifies an object. “r-value” refers to the data value that is stored at some address in memory. References in C++ are nothing but the alternative to the already existing variable. They are declared using the ‘&amp;amp;’ before the name of the variable.&#xA;Example:&#xA;int a = 10; // Declaring lvalue reference int&amp;amp; lref = a; // Declaring rvalue reference int&amp;amp;&amp;amp; rref = 20; Below is the implementation for lvalue and rvalue:</description>
